# continuous-delivery-javaee-container-src

**Note:** This is currently **not** a working demo that you can download and run. You can however from the source code figure out how to run the demo. As soon as times allows I will add instruction on how to get this running like a demo.

This repository contians the source code from the "Continuous Delivery with Docker Containers and Java EE" webinar that I (Thomas Qvarnstrom) and Markus Eisele preseted the 28th of April. For more information and recordings etc see Markus Eisele blog article about the webinar [here](http://blog.eisele.net/2015/04/continuous-delivery-with-docker.html)
